The buildpack will detect your RhoConnect app as Rack as it has a `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` files in the root directory. It will then proceed to run `bundle install` after setting up the appropriate environment for [ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) and [Bundler](http://gembundler.com). By default, it uses ruby `1.9.3`, unless you specify a particular version of Ruby in your appâ€™s `Gemfile`. Also, binaries of nodejs `v0.10.20` will installed and be accessible by app at run time.
